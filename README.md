Particles
=========

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulioC/Particles/master/demo.gif)

Simple particle system built with OpenGL and Qt, with support for Renderers, Intializers and Operators for a class assignment.

The project was really funny to work with. It was the first time I was touching OpenGL.

I'm leaving it public as reference. It should compile without problems with Qt and GCC.
